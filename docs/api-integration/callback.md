# Web Hook

To notify the store when a payment has been received, we use a web hook mechanism.
To receive information about payments in your store, register the endpoint to which you want to receive notifications
about payments in the merchantâ€™s store settings

Where the secret is used for signing

Be sure to check the box next to A new payment has been received

Receiving a callback in order to find out about a payment, you need to create an endpoint on the integrator side to
which the merchant will send an event at the given moment. The merchant supports only one event option: receiving a
payment

To secure the store, a signature mechanism is used. The merchant transmits a hashed sha256 string in the X-sign header,
which includes the body of the request being sent and the concatenated secret

For example, a merchant sends a web hook to the url `https://mystore.com/callback/merchant` with a POST request

The request body in this case will be like this

```Json
{
  "orderId": "",
  "status": "paid",
  "createdAt": "2023-09-15T07:31:46.000000Z",
  "paidAt": "2023-09-15T07:31:46.000000Z",
  "expiredAt": "2023-09-15T07:51:46.000000Z",
  "amount": 15,
  "receivedAmount": "15.00",
  "transactions": [
    {
      "txId": "98af9289aa06da5a13a9881dd2ee74ba85cfd1af20343ce50c6071275eea8e7b",
      "createdAt": "2023-09-15 07:31:46",
      "currency": "USDT",
      "blockchain": "tron",
      "amount": "15.00000000",
      "amountUsd": "15.00",
      "rate": "1.00000000"
    }
  ],
  "payer": {
    "id": "623cf62d-7ec3-4b60-8abc-ba063f3bbf93",
    "storeUserId": "502162"
  }
}
```

our X-sign header will be eaba3d825829da2db79b95ef362e7b24a4c8b27fb643bad54d180e43ca9152de

Accordingly, on the store side it is worth checking the validity of the signature by creating the same hash and checking
it with the header

```php
$requestBodyString = '{"orderId":"","status":"paid","createdAt":"2023-09-15T07:31:46.000000Z","paidAt":"2023-09-15T07:31:46.000000Z","expiredAt":"2023-09-15T07:51:46.000000Z","amount":15,"receivedAmount":"15.00","transactions":[{"txId":"98af9289aa06da5a13a9881dd2ee74ba85cfd1af20343ce50c6071275eea8e7b","createdAt":"2023-09-15 07:31:46","currency":"USDT","blockchain":"tron","amount":"15.00000000","amountUsd":"15.00","rate"
:"1.00000000"}],"payer":{"id":"623cf62d-7ec3-4b60-8abc-ba063f3bbf93","storeUserId":"502162"}}';

$secret = 'c23a3ce904b4a9421d35590639f3589e0a491bf7'

$sign = hash('sha256', $requestBodyString . $secret); //eaba3d825829da2db79b95ef362e7b24a4c8b27fb643bad54d180e43ca9152de
```

if for some reason it was not possible to receive a 200 response from the store, after some time the merchant will send the message again, the frequency of sending increases exponentially
